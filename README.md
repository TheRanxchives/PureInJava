### Dear Reader,

#### Who knows whether I may return, but I can assure you this is *<u>not a goodbye</u>*. I am *<u>running low</u>* on ideas for the moment after <u>*Commit-a-thon Chapter 2*</u> would have ended because that is when I am putting this up. Crazy how you get this <u>*influx of Ideas*</u> and then, You all-over sudden don't have anything. It's kinda something that is out of *<u>my control.</u>* I am trying my best to <u>*come up with Ideas*</u> while writing this but it is just <u>*not coming to me*</u>. So yeah, *<u>don't expect anything crazy right now</u>*. Thank you! Let me repeat my statement before I wind up - *<u>This is not a good bye</u>*. I *<u>don't have anything to share currently</u>*, so I don't have anything good to work on. *<u>I will update - or commit if anything ever changes.</u>* And if you see one -* <u>by the time I am commiting I would have updated this*</u>.
